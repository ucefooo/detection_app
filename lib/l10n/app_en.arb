Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.",

  "leishmaniasis_description":"Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease caused by the Leishmania parasite, transmitted to humans through the bites of infected sand flies. It primarily affects the skin, mucous membranes, and internal organs, causing a range of clinical manifestations.",
  "worldwide_statistics": "Worldwide Statistics",
  "worldwide_statistics_description": "Leishmaniasis affects millions across 98 countries, mainly in tropical and subtropical regions. The WHO estimates that around 700,000 to 1 million new cases occur annually, with over 20,000 deaths.",
  "morocco_statistics": "Morocco Statistics",
  "morocco_statistics_description": "In Morocco, cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis are more common, particularly in rural areas. The country has observed fluctuating cases, influenced by factors like climate, socio-economic status, and public health efforts.",
  "transmissionhow": "How It Spreads",
  "transmissioncycle": "Understanding the Transmission Cycle",
  "transmission_description": "The transmission of leishmaniasis occurs through the bite of an infected female sand fly. When the fly bites a person or an animal carrying the parasite, it ingests the parasite, which then develops in the fly's gut. Once mature, the parasites travel to the fly's mouthparts, enabling transmission to a new host through another bite, continuing the cycle.",

  "transmissioncyclestep10": "This cycle represents both the infective and diagnostic stages of leishmaniasis transmission.",
  "transmissioncyclestep11": "Clinical Forms",
  "transmissioncyclestep12": "Leishmaniasis is caused by a protozoa parasite from over 20 Leishmania species. Over 90 sandfly species are known to transmit Leishmania parasites. There are 3 main forms of the disease:",
  "transmissioncyclestep13": "Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL)",
  "transmissioncyclestep14": "VL, also known as kala-azar, is fatal if left untreated in over 95% of cases. It is characterized by irregular bouts of fever, weight loss, enlargement of the spleen and liver, and anaemia. Most cases occur in Brazil, east Africa and India. An estimated 50,000 to 90,000 new cases of VL occur worldwide annually, with only 25-45% reported to WHO. It has outbreak and mortality potential.",
  "transmissioncyclestep15": "Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL)",
  "transmissioncyclestep16": "CL is the most common form and causes skin lesions, mainly ulcers, on exposed parts of the body. These can leave life-long scars and cause serious disability or stigma. About 95% of CL cases occur in the Americas, the Mediterranean basin, the Middle East and central Asia. It is estimated that 600,000 to 1 million new cases occur worldwide annually but only around 200,000 are reported to WHO.",
  "transmissioncyclestep17": "Mucocutaneous Leishmaniasis",
